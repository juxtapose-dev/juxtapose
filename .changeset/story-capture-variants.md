Per-story capture variants. Declare `variants` on a story's juxtapose params, on a URL entry, or project-wide in `juxtapose.config.json`, for example `{ "variants": { "dark": { "colorScheme": "dark" }, "mobile": { "viewport": { "width": 375, "height": 812 } } } }`. Each variant is captured, judged and approved on its own under the key `<story id>__<variant>`. A story can opt out of a project variant with `false`, and `extends` builds one variant on another. Existing baselines are default captures and keep passing.

`jux run --story <id>` now works: a story id captures the story with all its variants, a capture key just that one, and an unknown id exits 2. The MCP `run` tool's `stories` argument now applies the same selection. `jux approve --story` and the MCP `approve` tool accept a story id to approve every variant in the run. Story ids in the commands that the PR comment and handoff print are now shell-quoted.

`jux run --since` now captures every story when `juxtapose.config.json` or `.juxtaposerc.json` changes, because a project-wide variant there changes every story's captures. The exported `Page` interface gains an optional `setColorScheme`. A `Page` implemented outside core doesn't need it: core falls back to raw `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`.
