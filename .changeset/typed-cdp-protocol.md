CDP calls are typed through Chrome's own protocol definitions (`devtools-protocol`, a types-only dependency of `@juxtapose/core`, pinned to the protocol revision of the pinned Chrome), and JSON read from disk or the wire is checked where it enters instead of cast. Files that are not what they claim now fail with a message at the boundary: a `report.json` that is not a run report, a structure sidecar that is not one `jux` wrote (read as absent, like a corrupt one), and a review-server `/run` body whose `storyIds` is not a list of ids (400). Capture output is unchanged.
