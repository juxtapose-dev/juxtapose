## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 31bc685: Capture through juxtapose's own CDP driver instead of Playwright. Captures stay byte-identical (verified on both example workbenches), so existing baselines remain valid and nothing needs re-approving.

  Playwright is no longer a dependency or peer dependency. The browser is a pinned `chrome-headless-shell` 151.0.7922.34, installed once with `npx -p @juxtapose/cli jux browser install` (also `jux browser status` and `jux browser path`). An existing `ms-playwright` cache of the same build is reused and nothing is downloaded. New: `JUX_CHROME=<path>` or `--chrome <path>` uses your own Chromium, and `JUX_CACHE_DIR` moves the cache.

  **Breaking:**

  - Mask and `--wait-for` selectors must be CSS. Playwright-only syntax (`text=`, `>>`, `:has-text()`, `:visible`, `nth=`) now fails the story with `jux: selector '…' is not a CSS selector` instead of silently matching nothing.
  - Node >= 22.2.0 is required (it was 20).
  - Adapters receive `@juxtapose/core`'s `Page`, not Playwright's. Third-party adapters that used Playwright-only `Page` methods need to move to the `Page` interface core exports.

### Patch Changes

- 373ff1b: `jux run --since` says why a story changed: the verdict gains `cause`, the
  story's import closure intersected with the changed files, with
  `partial: true` when that closure could not be fully traced. `RunReport.groups`
  lists every change shared by two or more failing stories. `jux diff --crops`
  writes side-by-side strips per changed region (`juxtapose.crops/v1`), no
  browser (below the pixel tolerance, the changed elements instead); `jux
handoff` ends with that command. Core exports `shellQuote`. A child whose box only
  followed its parent's move or resize is no longer a delta. A Claude Code
  plugin with the `visual-check` skill lives in `plugins/claude-code/`. The review server's merged reports regroup over all results.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f40f5cf: Record what captured each baseline

  Baselines now carry a `CaptureEnv` — browser version, OS/arch, and the libvips
  that encoded the WebP. Under a byte-exact hash a toolchain bump and a real
  regression look identical, so an all-red suite could not be explained. This is
  the fact that explains it.

  The encoder is a separate field because it moves bytes far more readily than the
  browser does. Measured on the examples: a libvips bump changed all 17 baseline
  hashes with zero changed pixels, while Chromium 149 to 151 left 16 of 18 stories
  byte-identical.

  Existing baselines have no fingerprint and are left alone; an unknown
  environment is treated as unknown rather than as current, so nothing is
  silently assumed to match. Approvals made from the CLI, from `init`, and from
  the addon panel all record it.

### Patch Changes

- 474a0db: Add npm keywords and a homepage link to each package

  Nothing installed changes; this is what the registry listing shows and how the
  packages are found in search.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d47ddc4: Watch mode: recapture stories as you edit them.

  Storybook's own render event is the trigger rather than a file watcher — HMR
  rerenders a story, and the story knows which component file it came from, so
  there is no second source of truth about which files matter. A render counts as
  an edit only when no navigation preceded it, which is what separates "I saved a
  file" from "I clicked a story in the sidebar".

  Scope is every story sharing the edited component. When a static build is
  available the import graph widens that to dependents; the dev server has no
  bundler graph, so without one it stays at the component. `liveCapture: false`
  opts a story out of live recapture while leaving normal runs alone.

  Unlike `jux run`'s analysis, an uncertain answer here narrows rather than
  capturing everything: this fires on a keystroke pause, where escalating to the
  whole suite is a hang rather than a safety net. CI remains the backstop.

### Patch Changes

- c28a95a: Trim the public API surface before it becomes a semver commitment.

  `@juxtapose/core` exported sixteen symbols with no consumer outside the package
  — `armSettle`, `waitForPaint`, `DOM_IDLE_MS`, `captureStory`, `capturePool`,
  `diffImages`, `computeChangedRegions` and similar. These are exactly the
  internals CLAUDE.md describes as load-bearing and easy to break, so publishing
  them invites downstream code to pin the parts that most need freedom to change.
  The barrel is now organised by who consumes it — adapter authors, store
  authors, run drivers, reporters — with a note saying so.

  `formatPercent` moves to `core` and is shared. It had five copies, one already
  stylistically drifted, and it encodes a product rule rather than a format: a
  real change must never display as "0.00%".

  `hashImage` is now exported and used by the review server, which had its own
  copy. Anything comparing against a manifest entry has to use the function the
  manifest was written with; a second implementation silently diverges the moment
  the algorithm changes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 97b4994: Initial release.

  Visual regression testing for component workbenches, with Storybook and Ladle
  adapters behind a shared platform seam.

  - Pass/fail is a byte-exact hash against a committed manifest; the pixel diff is
    a cold path that only runs to explain a failure.
  - Baselines live in the repo by default, so approving a change is a reviewable
    diff in the pull request that caused it. S3/R2 is available behind the same
    interface.
  - Affected-story analysis walks the Vite build manifest and escalates to a full
    run on any uncertainty.
  - `jux handoff` emits an agent-ready prompt carrying exact mismatch figures and
    changed-region coordinates rather than screenshots.
