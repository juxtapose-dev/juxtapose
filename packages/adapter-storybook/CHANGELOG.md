- 474a0db: Add npm keywords and a homepage link to each package

  packages are found in search.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 0c1826a: Explain why two packages both say "Storybook".

  `@juxtapose/storybook` is the addon you install; `@juxtapose/adapter-storybook`
  is how the CLI drives a browser, and arrives as a dependency. Nothing renamed —
  the addon keeps the short name, matching `@chromatic-com/storybook` — but the
  docs never said which was which, which made the split look backwards.

  The addon's directory is now `packages/storybook/` rather than
  `packages/addon-storybook/`, so every directory matches its published name.
  That mismatch is what produced a changeset naming a package that did not exist,
  which failed the release.

### Minor Changes

- 97b4994: Initial release.

  Visual regression testing for component workbenches, with Storybook and Ladle
  adapters behind a shared platform seam.

  - Pass/fail is a byte-exact hash against a committed manifest; the pixel diff is
    a cold path that only runs to explain a failure.
  - Baselines live in the repo by default, so approving a change is a reviewable
    diff in the pull request that caused it. S3/R2 is available behind the same
    interface.
  - Affected-story analysis walks the Vite build manifest and escalates to a full
    run on any uncertainty.
  - `jux handoff` emits an agent-ready prompt carrying exact mismatch figures and
    changed-region coordinates rather than screenshots.
