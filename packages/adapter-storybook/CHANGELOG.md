# @juxtapose/adapter-storybook

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 97b4994: Initial release.

  Visual regression testing for component workbenches, with Storybook and Ladle
  adapters behind a shared platform seam.

  - Pass/fail is a byte-exact hash against a committed manifest; the pixel diff is
    a cold path that only runs to explain a failure.
  - Baselines live in the repo by default, so approving a change is a reviewable
    diff in the pull request that caused it. S3/R2 is available behind the same
    interface.
  - Affected-story analysis walks the Vite build manifest and escalates to a full
    run on any uncertainty.
  - `jux handoff` emits an agent-ready prompt carrying exact mismatch figures and
    changed-region coordinates rather than screenshots.
